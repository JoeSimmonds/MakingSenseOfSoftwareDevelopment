### Build the right thing

### Build it right

# One person can build software quickly

But beyond certain level of complexity/scale we require multiple people

We also need other skills to be sure we are building the right thing

---

# Software Development is a social activity

Note:
 - 80% of writing the software happens AFK
 - The act of encoding your thoughts is when you type in the program

---
# Context
# Variables
 - Your audience
 - Your project
 - Your Stakeholders
 - Your Team
 - You

"... because as we know, there are known knowns; there are things we know we know. We also know there are known unknowns; that is to say we know there are some things we do not know. But there are also unknown unknowns â€” the ones we don't know we don't know."
    (Donald Rumsfeld)

Complexity emerges in social activities as the number of variable factors goes up.

Complexity has phase boundaries just like physics

---

# When stuff is obvious or well understood

---

# When things are difficult

---

# When things are poorly understood ?

---

# When things are just weird

---

We all have a home, where we feel most comfortable.

---

# When stuff is obvious or well understood
### Practitioners
 - What type of problem is it
 - Apply the best practice

---

# When things are difficult
### Experts
 - Analyze the problem
 - Implement a solution

---

#  When things are poorly understood ?
### Experimenters
 - Conduct a test
 - Check the results
 - continue or halt

Note:
  - Deming Cycle
  - Rememeber that experiments are guided by expertise and prior knowledge

--

# When things are just weird
Intuition based

---

We will tend to interpret things as being in that zone.

    - People comfortable with a certain way of tackling problem will tend to believe that their current situation is amenable to that technique

    It's a TRAP!

Note:
 - insert mental image of Admiral Ackbar here :)

### We must invest some time and effort in managing the complexity that comes from these confounding variables
#### Thankfully we do

---

# Retros

---

Things can move or be moved between the different types of complexity

Note:
  - Handling emergency situations by simplifying them so that they can be reasoned about 
  - Shuttering
  - Pushing yourself into a chaotic situation to enable innovation
  - Spikes
  - Training
  - Splitting the problem

---
So ... We have a choice.  We can attempt to deal with the complexity

or we can try to move the problem into another type of complexity

---

# TLDR;
 - Best practice is a myth in a world with any complexity
 - You and your team are best placed to understand what is needed
 - Testing ideas can help
 - Use your retros!
 - Experts can help you but ...
 - ... sometimes experiments can be better 
 - Your Scrum Masters are experts in this stuff
