# One person can build software quickly

But beyond certain level of complexity/scale we require multiple people

We also need other skills to be sure we are building the right thing

# Software Development is a social activity

Note:
 - 80% of writing the software happens AFK
 - The act of encoding your thoughts is when you type in the program

# Context
# Variables
 - Your audience
 - Your project
 - Your Stakeholders
 - Your Team
 - You

# It would be fine if it wasn't for all of these pesky users

---

# It would be fine if it wasn't for all of these pesky stakeholders

---

# It would be fine if it wasn't for all of these pesky designers

---

# It would all be fine if it wasn't for all of these pesky developers

---

# We must invest some time and effort in managing the complexity that comes from these confounding variables
### Thankfully we do

# Retros

Complexity emerges in social activities as the number of variable factors goes up.

Complexity has phase boundaries just like physics

---

# When stuff is obvious or well understood

---

# When things are difficult

---

# When things are poorly understood ?

---

# When things are just weird

---

We all have a home, where we feel most comfortable.

Obvious - Practitioners
Complex - Experts
Complicated - Experimenters
Chaotic - Intuition based

---

We will tend to interpret things as being in that zone.

    - People comfortable with a certain way of tackling problem will tend to believe that their current situation is amenable to that technique

    It's a TRAP!

---

Things can move or be moved between the different types of complexity

Note:
  - Handling emergency situations by simplifying them so that they can be reasoned about 
  - Shuttering
  - Pushing yourself into a chaotic situation to enable innovation

# TLDR;
 - Best practice is a myth in a world with any complexity
 - You and your team are best placed to understand what is needed
 - Testing ideas can help
 - Use your retros!
 - Your Scrum Masters are experts in this stuff
